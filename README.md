# ** Project: Logic Gate Controlled LED with Arduino IoT
Description:
This project allows you to control the brightness and behavior of an LED using different logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) through the Arduino IoT Cloud. The LED's behavior is controlled based on the values of two boolean inputs (a and b), and the logic gate can be selected through a dashboard. You can also adjust the LED's brightness and turn it on or off through the cloud. **

__ What I Used:
Arduino Uno R4 Cloud: The main microcontroller that interfaces with the IoT Cloud.
Arduino IoT Cloud: Used to create a dashboard for controlling the LED, adjusting the brightness, and selecting the logic gate.
LED: Connected to PWM pin 11, controlled for brightness and logic gate behavior.
Arduino IDE: For writing and uploading the code.


Skills I Learned:
Arduino IoT Cloud: I learned how to use the Arduino IoT Cloud to create an interactive dashboard that communicates with an Arduino board over the internet.
PWM Control: I practiced controlling an LED's brightness using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) based on cloud inputs.
Cloud-to-Device Communication: I learned how to send and receive data between the Arduino and the cloud in real-time. __
